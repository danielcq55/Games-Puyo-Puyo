Rules of the Game: 
---------------

* Spheres come down from the top of the game board in pairs. 
* Spheres come in  7 different colors.
* Player can moves the pair using arrows.
* Linking four spheres of the same color (horizontally, vertically or both(as in tetris)) removes them from the game board, allowing any sphere remaining to drop and fill the vacated space. 
This may lead to several possible "chain combos" if additional colors match. 

Controls:

*  To pause the game press SHIFT
*  To move the pair of spheres use arrows.
*  To close the game press ESC or CTRL-C or just close the window.
*  To run the game go to bin directory and type: java PuyoFrame

Known issues and bugs:

* The player can't rotate the spheres of the pair.
* When a linking is produced and some spheres are removed, the remaining ones, which fill the vacated spaces, are not immediately linked.

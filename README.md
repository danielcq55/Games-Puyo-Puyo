Rules of the Game: 
---------------

* Spheres come down from the top of the game board in pairs. 
* Spheres come in  7 different colors.
* Player can move the pair using arrows.
* Player can rotate the pair of spheres.
* Linking four spheres of the same color (horizontally, vertically or both(as in tetris)) removes them from the game board, allowing any sphere remaining to drop and fill the vacated space. 
This may lead to several possible "chain combos" if additional colors match. 

Controls:

*  To pause the game press SHIFT
*  To move the pair of spheres use arrows.
*  To rotate the pair of spheres press CTRL.
*  To close the game press ESC, CTRL-C or just close the window.
*  To run the game go to bin directory and type: java PuyoFrame

Known issues and bugs:


* When a linking is produced and some spheres are removed, the remaining ones, which fill the vacated spaces, are not immediately linked.
